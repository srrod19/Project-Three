  <h2>About Me: Sasha Rodriguez :)</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Sasha Rodriguez and I am a third-year Communications Major and my specialization is in Technology and Business. I grew up in Chicago for most of my life, moving into the city when I was about 12 and prior to that I lived in a small town just outside of the city off of the Pink Line.</p>
    <p>I enjoy many things outside of school and could talk hours about my many passions.</p>
    <p>Recently, I developed a cycling hobby and I enjoy riding around the city of Chicago with friends and participating in many group rides. I also love baking, music, and a sense of community.</p>
    <p>I am apart of the radio station here at IIT as a Music Director. I recently purchased a Cinelli fixed gear bike with a flip-flop hub for this season. I have baked many things and even started a mini recipe book of things that I have baked in the past. Sometimes I bake for group rides. This past summer I baked brookies, pumpkin cookies, chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter blossoms, and many other things. I pack them in my bookbag and lift off on my bike to go see other people on bikes. It's a really fun way to build community and meet new people all across Chicago.</p>
