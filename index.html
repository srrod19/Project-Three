  <h2>About Me: Sasha Rodriguez :)</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Sasha Rodriguez and I am a third-year Communications Major and my specialization is in Technology and Business. I grew up in Chicago for most of my life, moving into the city when I was about 12 and prior to that I lived in a small town just outside of the city off of the Pink Line.</p>
    <p>I enjoy many things outside of school and could talk hours about my many passions.</p>
    <p>Recently, I developed a cycling hobby and I enjoy riding around the city of Chicago with friends and participating in many group rides. I also love baking, music, and a sense of community.</p>
    <p>I am apart of the radio station here at IIT as a Music Director. I recently purchased a Cinelli fixed gear bike with a flip-flop hub for this season. I have baked many things and even started a mini recipe book of things that I have baked in the past. Sometimes I bake for group rides. This past summer I baked brookies, pumpkin cookies, chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter blossoms, and many other things. I pack them in my bookbag and lift off on my bike to go see other people on bikes. It's a really fun way to build community and meet new people all across Chicago.</p>

  <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>I listen to a variety of different genres on a daily basis, as a Music Director my role is to introduce new music to IIT students through our automation system and I recevie countless emails regarding new singles, album releases, and upcoming concerts. You can find out more about WIIT 88.9FM <a href="https://radio.iit.edu/">here</a></p>
    <p>Lately, I have been back into a lot of 80s industrial music with my favorite artists being <strong>Ministry</strong> and <strong>My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult</strong>(TKK). Both of which are originally from Chicago, and while everyone knows about <strong>The Smashing Pumpkins</strong> not much is said about <strong>TKK</strong> being the real Chicagoans.</p>
    <p>I also really enjoy attending shows and concerts. Live music is truly a different form of music because you get to see and hear and feel your favorite songs be played for you all the while you dance and sing and feel free to express the way that the music makes you feel. It comes alive in a completely different form that you never knew existed, even if you've heard the song a million times it shocks you in a way you will never feel through your headphones. It makes me happy to be able to show someone an artist they normally wouldn't listen to and show them why exactly they get so much praise.</p>
    <p>For a while, I was documenting and interviewing local musicians for a school newspaper. Connecting with artists on a personal level brings me closer to music as well. I also gain that sense of community within the music scene because I get to bring new eyes to their music and projects.</p>
    <p>Here is my recommened playlist if you are interested in hearing some new music from the 80s industrial era.</p>
