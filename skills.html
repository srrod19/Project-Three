  <h1>Riding No-Hands</h1>
  <h2>What You Need</h2>
    <p>For this trick the main thing to be sure you feel most comfortable on is your bike. If you do not feel comfortable balancing, shifting, or handling yourself on your bike you will fail. This trick is very easy to master and becomes fun and exciting as you continue to practice. Riding without gripping the handle-bars is a simple trick that many people are able to get right off the bat if they have been riding for a while. For me, the hardest part was trusting myself. If you don't have trust in yourself try riding with only one hand and move on from there.</p>
    <p>I will detail the steps you should be taking in order to make sure you are capable of doing this on your own! Don't be afraid to start slow and take it one day at a time. Like all things, practice is required.</p>
  <h3>No-Hands Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Get comfortable balancing on your bike(Stationary). Place your foot on a stable surface that is slightly elevated, like a curb or stair.</li>
    <li>Be sure to check that your handlebars are straight and aligned in the center with your front wheel to avoid accidents.</li>
    <li>Find a smooth long stretch of isolated ground in order to practice.</li>
    <li>Once you have checked everything and feel comfortable balancing on your bike, begin to peddle and gain momentum.</li>
    <li>Begin by shifting your balance into your saddle.</li>
    <li>Remove one hand from the bar and maintain your speed. Look straight ahead do not look down at your hands.</li>
    <li>Steady your hands and remove the second hand off the bar. At first it might feel uncomfortable but eventually it will become second nature. If you feel scared or nervous return your hands to the handlebars.</li>
    <li>Build confidence. After you feel like you are able to keep your hands off for longer periods of time begin using your hips and core in order to shift the bike towards the direction you want to go.</li>
    <li><strong>Most importantly:</strong> Be Safe!</li>
  </ol>
